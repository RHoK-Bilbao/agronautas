RHoK-Bilbao 2012 (@rhokbilbao) project for ecologic solar cookers (Problem proposed by @pezestudio)

The solar cookers have an arduino board that connects to a central server to update information about its usage.

This information is then shared as Linked Open Data and visualized in a web interface
